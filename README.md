GMS registration form 

Features:
 - Totally independent of whatever the convoluted framework people want to use for MemberDB (insert year here) is
   - Therefore can be reused regardless of how many incomplete versions of MemberDB people make
 - Isn't the scanned, hand written, pdf form we have used for the last X years
 - Doesn't use a text file like all our other online forms

Flaws:
 - Don't care about validation much
 - Don't care about user friendliness much
 - Don't even care about security much, because it's not actually MemberDB
 - Would probably break, if we had like, more than 200 people use it at the same time, cos that's going to happen
 - Makes wheel members go all glazy eyed and talk about frameworks
